## 1. Problem Statement

Peak Energy is a U.S.-based energy storage company building
grid-scale battery systems based on sodium-ion cell chemistry. The
company designs passively cooled, long-duration storage products
aimed at utility and grid applications, and is developing domestic
manufacturing capacity for cells and systems. Its operations span
engineering and corporate functions in Colorado alongside cell
development and manufacturing activity in California.

Peak Energy publishes its careers board through Greenhouse at
the bare slug `peakenergy`. The run-398 batch sweep confirmed
30 live role(s) via a direct probe of
`https://api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/peakenergy/jobs?content=true`.
Sector: CleanTech / Energy Storage. HQ: Broomfield, Colorado, USA.

## 2. Goals

- Ship a `source-company-peakenergy` plugin returning live
  `JobPostDto` rows from the Greenhouse board.
- Mirror the canonical variant-2 + D-08 company-direct template
  (wire `company_name` pass-through; defensive title/department
  trim; entity-decode-then-tag-strip descriptions).
- Bundle a unit-test suite (≥ 9 cases) with a mocked HTTP fixture.
- Publish the plugin's `Module` in `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES`.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Authenticated Greenhouse Harvest API support.
- Backfilling historical Peak Energy postings.
- Cross-board enrichment or salary inference.

## 4. User / Caller Stories

> As an **aggregator caller**, I want **`Site.PEAK_ENERGY`** in the
> source registry, so that **a single `siteType: [Site.PEAK_ENERGY]`
> request returns Peak Energy's open roles**.

## 5. Functional Requirements

| ID    | Requirement                                                                 | Priority |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-1  | Add `Site.PEAK_ENERGY = 'peakenergy'` to the `Site` enum.               | must     |
| FR-2  | New plugin package `@ever-jobs/source-company-peakenergy`.                  | must     |
| FR-3  | `PeakEnergyService.scrape(input)` returns a `JobResponseDto`; never throws. | must   |
| FR-4  | The plugin is registered in `ALL_SOURCE_MODULES`.                          | must     |
| FR-5  | `tsconfig.base.json` path-alias + matching `jest.config.js` mapper.      | must     |
| FR-6  | Each `JobPostDto` `id` prefixed `peakenergy-`, `site === Site.PEAK_ENERGY`. | must |
| FR-7  | `input.resultsWanted` honoured.                                           | must     |
| FR-8  | `input.searchTerm` honoured (title + department substring).               | should   |
| FR-9  | Network errors caught — returns `{ jobs: [] }`.                            | must     |
| FR-10 | ≥ 9 unit tests with mocked HTTP.                                            | must     |
| FR-11 | D-08 decode-then-strip pipeline.                                            | must     |
| FR-12 | Wire `absolute_url` flows through to `jobUrl` (variant 2).               | must     |
| FR-13 | D-10 defensive `.trim()` on wire titles.                                   | must     |
| FR-14 | D-11 defensive `.trim()` on wire department names.                         | must     |

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-1..NFR-4 — same as cohort baseline (no new runtime deps;
`Promise`-based async; `Logger` not `console`; resilient to
malformed payloads).

## 7. Contracts

### 7.1 API / Interface

```ts
@SourcePlugin({ site: Site.PEAK_ENERGY, name: 'Peak Energy', category: 'company' })
@Injectable()
export class PeakEnergyService implements IScraper {
  scrape(input: ScraperInputDto): Promise<JobResponseDto>;
}
```

### 7.2 Errors

All transport errors swallowed; caller sees `{ jobs: [] }`.

## 8. Test Plan

- ≥ 9 cases. Happy-path asserts variant-2 URL pass-through
  (`job-boards.greenhouse.io/peakenergy/jobs/<id>`), wire
  `company_name` pass-through (`'Peak Energy'`),
  D-10 title-trim lock, D-11 department-trim lock, and the
  D-08 decode-then-strip regression guard.
- Plus standard cohort cases (resultsWanted cap, searchTerm
  match + non-match, HTTP 500 error handling, empty payload).

## 9. Open Questions

(none open — see § 10 Decisions.)

## 10. Decisions

- **D-04 (run #398):** Wire-shape variant 2 (canonical hosted-board
  host `job-boards.greenhouse.io/peakenergy/jobs/<id>`).
- **D-08 (run #398):** Decode-then-strip description pipeline.
- **D-09 (run #398):** Wire `company_name` pass-through
  (`'Peak Energy'`).
- **D-10 (run #398):** Defensive `.trim()` on wire titles.
- **D-11 (run #398):** Defensive `.trim()` on wire department names.
